# RGB-Hex-Converter
Small app I made in **Android Studio** that will convert RGB color values to Hex values and vice versa

I was having trouble figuring out what files / folders that Android Studio creates should be added to Github, and which are unneccesary; so I have included the main source files I created, and the APK for the app, along with several screenshots of the app.

The APK for the app is in apk/debug (called app-debug.apk)

The source files are in src/main with the resource files in /res and the java files in /java/.../rgbhexconverter
